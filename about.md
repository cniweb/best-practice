Hi, my name is Christian HÃ¤ussler and i live in Coburg, Germany.

In my work, I have a lot to do with software and development.

This blog is to document some of the best practices for software products.

Have questions or suggestions?
Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/cniweb/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisHaeusslerC).

Thanks for reading!
